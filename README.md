# Discounts & Sales
_Ever wanted to put items on sale to reduce stock or make a quick profit? Well, now you can!_

## About the mod

This mod allows you to put certain items in your store on sale with a 20% (or configurable alternative) discount. This does **not** attract more customers to your store but it **DOES** attract already existing customers towards these **products**.

To place a product on sale for a discount from the market price, click on the price tag (as you would to change the price) and press **T** (configurable). If it tells you you cannot discount this product, it means that with a discount you will not make a profit greater than $1 per item so it would be redundant to put it on sale. (This limit of $1 is changeable in the config)

This will place a red sale tag on the item shelf and also display a red painted cardboard sign in the shop window. You should notice an increase in the amount of customers buying the item you have placed on sale.

At the moment, you can only place **8** items on sale at any given time. This is subject to change in future as 8 sometimes may be too little, it all depends on your store.

## Planned Features

* A fancy sale sign to be placed above shelf displays
* Ability to set mixed discounts (i.e. some products 20%, some 10%)
* Increased max products on sale proportional to your store level and available licenses.

## Known Issues

* Some visual bugs with sale tags.
